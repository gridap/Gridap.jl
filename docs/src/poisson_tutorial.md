# Poisson Equation Tutorial (draft)

This tutorial aims to show how to solve a simple Poisson equation using Gridap.jl.

## Goals of this tutorial

- Show how to define basic model and mesh.
- Explain how to define trial and test finite element spaces.
- Demonstrate how to apply Dirichlet boundary conditions in a way that is easy for beginners to follow through
- Solve the Poisson problem and briefly inspect the results.

## This is a work in progress. Next steps:

- Adding complete runnable example in Julia.
- Adding inline explanations of each major function call.
- + Notes on common mistakes and debugging tips.
