- Replaced newest vertex bisection mesh adaptation in
  `src/Geometry/NewestVertexBisection.jl` with appropriate changes to
  `src/Adaptivity/EdgeBasedRefinement.jl`. Since PR
  [#901](https://github.com/gridap/Gridap.jl/pull/901).
- When refining `DiscreteModels`, the `FaceLabeling` of the resulting `AdaptedDiscreteModel` will now correctly inhering the tags of the parent model. This has been made possible by the addition of the method `get_d_to_face_to_parent_face`. Since PR[#886](https://github.com/gridap/Gridap.jl/pull/886).
- Added support for mixed adaptivity (i.e coarsening and refining), as well as non-conforming adaptivity. Since PR[#886](https://github.com/gridap/Gridap.jl/pull/886).

### Fixed

- ODE operators cache linear system at initial time or the time stored by the operator. Before, the linear system was cached at time `t = 0.0`, which cannot be done if the operator is not well-defined at `t = 0.0`. Since PR [#891](https://github.com/gridap/Gridap.jl/pull/891).
- Fixed the method `get_normal_vector` for `AdaptedTriangulation`. The method `get_facet_normal`
  was using default, it's now using the spetialized implementation for the underlying triangulation type.
  Since PR [#884](https://github.com/gridap/Gridap.jl/pull/884).
- Fixed `cell_dof_ids` for the case of vectorial `ConstantFESpace`. Since PR [#888](https://github.com/gridap/Gridap.jl/pull/888)

- Fixed: Domain limits can now be of any type (notably, floats) when refining `CartesianDiscreteModels`. Since PR[#886](https://github.com/gridap/Gridap.jl/pull/886).

## [0.17.17] - 2023-02-24

### Added

- Implemented `RefinementRule` and `AdaptivityGlue`, which encode the mapping between the old and new cells in an adapted model. Since PR [#838](https://github.com/gridap/Gridap.jl/pull/838).
- Implemented `AdaptedDiscreteModel` and `AdaptedTriangulation`, representing respectively a model and triangulation produced by adapting a parent model. This types mostly wrap around `DiscreteModel` and `Triangulation`, with some added features necessary to keep track of the adaptive hierarchy. Since PR [#838](https://github.com/gridap/Gridap.jl/pull/838).
- Implemented tools to be able to transfer `CellDatum`s back and forth between parent and child grids. These include changes to `change_domain` (which now takes the source `Triangulation` as argument) and a new type of `Measure` called `CompositeMeasure`, which allows the integration `Triangulation` to be different from the `Triangulation` of the resulting `DomainContribution`. To accommodate `CompositeMeasure`, `Measure` has been made abstract type and a `GenericMeasure` has been created to replace the old type. Since PR [#838](https://github.com/gridap/Gridap.jl/pull/838).
- For the fine-to-coarse transfer of `CellField`s, the new `FineToCoarseField` has been implemented. This new structure bundles several fields defined on the fine mesh to create a single field on the coarse mesh. To enable fast interpolation of this type of field, we have also implemented `FineToCoarseReferenceFE` and `FineToCoarseDofBasis`. Since PR [#838](https://github.com/gridap/Gridap.jl/pull/838).
- Implemented `CompositeQuadrature`, a quadrature for a cell that has been refined using a `RefinementRule`. Since PR [#838](https://github.com/gridap/Gridap.jl/pull/838).
- Implemented simple refinement strategies for Cartesian discrete models in 2&3D as well as Unstructured discrete models in 2D. The latter is implemented by red-green refinement. Since PR [#838](https://github.com/gridap/Gridap.jl/pull/838).
- Added optimization when calling `unique` for a `CompressedArray`. Since PR [#838](https://github.com/gridap/Gridap.jl/pull/838).
- Added support for changing domain between adapted triangulations in cases where the target triangulation is a view, a `BoundaryTriangulation` or a `SkeletonTriangulation`. Since PR [#868](https://github.com/gridap/Gridap.jl/pull/868).

### Fixed

- Using broadcasting through in `ODESolver` vector operations. Since PR [#860](https://github.com/gridap/Gridap.jl/pull/860)
- Fixes to `array_cache(a::Table)`: Now does not use the `zero(T,N)` function, but instead creates new empty vector using the general allocator `Vector{T}(undef,N)`. This allows `Table` to work with complex composite types which don't have an easy `zero(T)` function defined. Since PR [#838](https://github.com/gridap/Gridap.jl/pull/838).
- Added `get_metadata` to all the instances of `ReferenceFE`. This makes the abstract type more consistent, which is necessary for the new type `FineToCoarseReferenceFE`. Since PR [#838](https://github.com/gridap/Gridap.jl/pull/838).
- `ConstantFESpace` is now properly exported. Since PR [#872](https://github.com/gridap/Gridap.jl/pull/872).

## [0.17.16] - 2022-12-22

### Fixed

- Fixed a bug in function `collect_cell_matrix_and_vector`. Since PR [#849](https://github.com/gridap/Gridap.jl/pull/849)

## [0.17.15] - 2022-11-10

### Added

- BDM (Brezzi-Douglas-Marini) ReferenceFEs in PR [#823](https://github.com/gridap/Gridap.jl/pull/823)
- Implemented `ConstantFESpace`. This space allows, e.g., to impose the mean value of the pressure via an additional unknown/equation (a Lagrange multiplier). Since PR [#836](https://github.com/gridap/Gridap.jl/pull/836)
- Methods to construct `DiracDelta` at generic `Point`(s) in the domain. Since PR [#837](https://github.com/gridap/Gridap.jl/pull/837)
- some key missing `lastindex` and `end` tests belonging to PR [#834]. Since PR [#837](https://github.com/gridap/Gridap.jl/pull/837)
- `AbstractVector` support to weights and `Point`s of GenericQuadrature, in particular for `FillArray` usage. Since PR [#839](https://github.com/gridap/Gridap.jl/pull/839)
- Using the above generalization of `GenericQuadrature`, made the weights of quadrature of `DiracDelta` for generic points to be a `Fill` vector. Since PR [#839](https://github.com/gridap/Gridap.jl/pull/839)
- Optional keyword argument `T` to select the floating point precision for the numerical quadrature pipeline involving `Measure`, `CellQuadrature` and `Quadrature` functions. `T` defaults to `Float64` when not specified, so it doesn't involve any breaking changes in public API. Since PR [#840](https://github.com/gridap/Gridap.jl/pull/840)

## [0.17.14] - 2022-07-29

- Functionality to take jacobian of functional involving integration (`DomainContribution`) over Skeleton faces (obtained from testing bilinear form with the whole set of test `fe_basis`), with respect to the degrees-of-freedom of `FEFunction`.

- A dummy tag for ForwardDiff configs being constructed in Gridap at `src/Arrays/Autodiff.jl` to fix issue [#805](https://github.com/gridap/Gridap.jl/issues/805). Since PR [#806](https://github.com/gridap/Gridap.jl/pull/806)

  PR [#256](https://github.com/gridap/Gridap.jl/pull/256).

## [0.10.1] - 2020-05-19

### Fixed

- Added missing implementation of `simplexify(SEGMENT)` and `simplexify(VERTEX)`. Since PR [#252](https://github.com/gridap/Gridap.jl/pull/252).

## [0.10.0] - 2020-05-14

### Added

- Extended support of `TriangulationPortion` to boundary and skeleton triangulations. Since PR [#249](https://github.com/gridap/Gridap.jl/pull/249).
- Added `FESpaceWithLinearConstraints`. Since PR [#247](https://github.com/gridap/Gridap.jl/pull/247).
- Added inner constructor to `CartesianDiscreteModel` allowing to build a model that represents a subgrid of
  a larger grid. Since PR [#245](https://github.com/gridap/Gridap.jl/pull/245).

### Changed

- The part associated with the imposition of constraints in the `FESpace` interface has changed slightly. Since PR [#247](https://github.com/gridap/Gridap.jl/pull/247).
- Simplified the signature of `zero_free_values(::FESpace)`. Since PR [#249](https://github.com/gridap/Gridap.jl/pull/249).

  `collect_cell_matrix` as it is. Example: the old user code `assemble_matrix(assembler,collect_cell_matrix(du,dv,terms)...)`
  now is written simply as `assemble_matrix(assembler,collect_cell_matrix(du,dv,terms))`, i.e., the unpack of the last argument is not
  used anymore. In addition, with the new assembler interface, it is possible to customize the assembly process
  via a so-called `AssemblerStrategy` object. Since PR [#249](https://github.com/gridap/Gridap.jl/pull/249).

### Changed

- Renaming NonLinear to Nonlinear since it is one word and it is not consistent with style
- The definition of interpolation order in Raviart-Thomas and Nédélec reference FEs has changed. Now, the divergence of functions in the Raviart-Thomas space of order `k` belongs to `P_k` or `Q_k` depending on the underlying polytope. Idem for Nédelec, but using the curl instead of the divergence. Since PR [#212](https://github.com/gridap/Gridap.jl/pull/212).

- The order in which test and trial spaces are written in the code has changed and also the other in the arguments of functions defining bi-linear and linear forms, and weak residuals and Jacobians. **This affects everybody that is using Gridap, even the most basic users**. Now, we write the trial space before the test one in all methods taking two spaces in their arguments. E.g., we have changed `AffineFEOperator(V,U,terms...)` to `AffineFEOperator(U,V,terms...)`, where `U` is the trial and `V` is the test space. For functions defining weak forms, now we have: The new signatures for bi-linear and a linear forms are `a(u,v)`, `l(v)`, where `u` is a trial function and `v` is a test one. For weak Jacobians and residuals `jac(u,du,v)` and `res(u,v)`, where `u` is the (trial) function in which we evaluate these quantities, `du` is the direction in which we evaluate the Jacobian and `v` is a test function. Since PR [#195](https://github.com/gridap/Gridap.jl/pull/195) and PR [#197](https://github.com/gridap/Gridap.jl/pull/197).

- The part related with the application of constraints in the `FESpace` interface has changed. Since PR [#191](https://github.com/gridap/Gridap.jl/pull/191).
