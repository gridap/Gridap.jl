## [0.15.0] - Unreleased

This version is a major (backwards-incompatible) refactoring of the project which is not summarized here for the sake of brevity. Most of the functionality of v0.14.0 is available in v0.15.0, but possibly with a significantly different API. See [here](https://github.com/gridap/Tutorials/compare/v0.14.0...v0.15.0) the changes in the sources of the Gridap Tutorials between versions 0.14.0 and 0.15.0 to effectively see the major changes in the API.

### Removed
 - Support for Julia v1.0. Now, the minimum supported is Julia v1.3. Since PR [#376](https://github.com/gridap/Gridap.jl/pull/376/).

### Changed

## [0.13.4] - 2020-08-23

### Added

  Now, the user can omit `jac` from `FETerm(res,jac,trian,quad)`, i.e. `FETerm(res,trian,quad)` and the Jacobian will be automatically generated. In addition, the user can write `FEEnergy(ener,trian,quad)` for a given `ener(uh)` function
  and the residual and the Jacobian will be automatically generated. Since PR [#338](https://github.com/gridap/Gridap.jl/pull/338/).

### Changed
  - The meaning of `inward/outward` has slightly changed for `SkeletonCellBasis` objects. Now, by accessing to these properties a `ReducedSkeletonCellBasis` is returned, which allows to use the result in a more flexible way (in particular, the result can be used in a similar way than the result of `jump` or `mean`). Since PR [#317](https://github.com/gridap/Gridap.jl/pull/317).
  - Major refactoring in `ReferenceFEs` module. Since PR [#319](https://github.com/gridap/Gridap.jl/pull/319) and [#321](https://github.com/gridap/Gridap.jl/pull/321). In particular:
    - `NodalReferenceFE` has been replaced by a new abstract type `LagrangianRefFE`.
    - `GenericNodalCartesianRefFE` has been replaced by `GenericLagrangianRefFE`.

### Removed
  - Removals associated with the `ReferenceFEs` refactoring in PR [#319](https://github.com/gridap/Gridap.jl/pull/319):
    - Removed `QDiscRefFE` constructor. Use a standard `LagrangianRefFE` and `L2Conformity` instead.
    - Removed `PDiscRefFE` constructor. Use `LagrangianRefFE` constructor with the kw-argument `space=:P`.
    - Removed `CDLagrangianRefFE` constructor. Use a standard `LagrangianRefFE` and `CDConformity` instead.
    - Removed fields `face_own_dofs` and `face_own_dof_permutations` from `GenericRefFE`.
    - Removed struct `DiscRefFE`.

### Fixed
  - Better handling of FE terms defined on empty triangulations. Since PR [#329](https://github.com/gridap/Gridap.jl/pull/329).
  - Replaced `+=` by `add_entry!`. Since PR [#316](https://github.com/gridap/Gridap.jl/pull/316).
  - Minor fix to let Vtk.jl support changes in Vtk 1.7.X versus 1.6.X. Since PR [#324](https://github.com/gridap/Gridap.jl/pull/324).

### Changed

  - Major refactoring in the module `Gridap.TensorValues`.
  Since PR [#239](https://github.com/gridap/Gridap.jl/pull/239).
   **The following changes are likely to affect all users:**
    - The operator `*` is not allowed for expressing the dot product anymore. Use `LinearAlgebra.dot`
  function aka `⋅` (\cdot).
    - The syntax `∇*u` is not allowed anymore.  Use `∇⋅u` instead.

  often in Gridap code.
    - Function `n_components` is renamed to `num_components`.
  - The `SingleFieldFESpace` interface has changed. The function `gather_free_and_dirichlet_values!`
  has been added as mandatory for all FE space implementations and the old function `gather_free_and_dirichlet_values`
  is now optional. Since PR [#279](https://github.com/gridap/Gridap.jl/pull/279).

    now is written simply as `assemble_matrix(assembler,collect_cell_matrix(du,dv,terms))`, i.e., the unpack of the last argument is not
    used anymore.  In addition, with the new assembler interface, it is possible to customize the assembly process
    via a so-called `AssemblerStrategy` object. Since PR [#249](https://github.com/gridap/Gridap.jl/pull/249).
  - Change the types of the sizes and partition fields of CartesianDescriptor to tuples instead of points.

  - Support for FE spaces with DOFs defined in the physical space. Since PR [#216](https://github.com/gridap/Gridap.jl/pull/216) and [#218](https://github.com/gridap/Gridap.jl/pull/218).

### Changed

  - Replaced `non_linear` -> `nonlinear` and `NonLinear` -> `Nonlinear`. Since PR [#223](https://github.com/gridap/Gridap.jl/pull/223).

## [0.8.0] - 2020-03-17

### Added

- Support for surface-coupled multi-physics. See [`SurfaceCouplingTests.jl`](https://github.com/gridap/Gridap.jl/blob/master/test/GridapTests/SurfaceCouplingTests.jl) for further details. Since PR [#209](https://github.com/gridap/Gridap.jl/pull/209).
- Support for constitutive laws with state / historical variables. See [`IsotropicDamageTests.jl`](https://github.com/gridap/Gridap.jl/blob/master/test/GridapTests/IsotropicDamageTests.jl) for further details. Since PR [#208](https://github.com/gridap/Gridap.jl/pull/208).
- Curl-conforming reference FE `NedelecRefFE` and corresponding FE space constructor since PR [#199](https://github.com/gridap/Gridap.jl/pull/199).
- New constructors `AffineFETermFromCellMatVec` and `FETermFromCellJacRes` that provides full control in the definition of cell matrices and vectors. Since PR [#191](https://github.com/gridap/Gridap.jl/pull/191).
- Support for simultaneous integration of matrices and vectors. Since PR [#191](https://github.com/gridap/Gridap.jl/pull/191).

### Changed

- Renaming NonLinear to Nonlinear since it is one word and it is not consistent with style
- The definition of interpolation order in Raviart-Thomas and Nédélec reference FEs has changed. Now, the divergence of functions in the Raviart-Thomas space of order `k` belongs to `P_k` or `Q_k` depending on the underlying polytope. Idem for Nédelec, but using the curl instead of the divergence. Since PR [#212](https://github.com/gridap/Gridap.jl/pull/212).

- The order in which test and trial spaces are written in the code has changed and also the other in the arguments of functions defining bi-linear and linear forms, and weak residuals and Jacobians. **This affects everybody that is using Gridap, even the most basic users**. Now, we write the trial space before the test one in all methods taking two spaces in their arguments.  E.g., we have changed `AffineFEOperator(V,U,terms...)` to `AffineFEOperator(U,V,terms...)`, where `U` is the trial and `V` is the test space. For functions defining weak forms, now we have: The new signatures for bi-linear and a linear forms are `a(u,v)`, `l(v)`, where `u` is a trial function and `v` is a test one. For weak Jacobians and residuals `jac(u,du,v)` and `res(u,v)`, where `u` is the (trial) function in which we evaluate these quantities, `du` is the direction in which we evaluate the Jacobian and `v` is a test function. Since PR [#195](https://github.com/gridap/Gridap.jl/pull/195) and PR [#197](https://github.com/gridap/Gridap.jl/pull/197).

- The part related with the application of constraints in the `FESpace` interface has changed. Since PR [#191](https://github.com/gridap/Gridap.jl/pull/191).

### Fixed

- Bug in 1d Cartesian grids. Since PR [#192](https://github.com/gridap/Gridap.jl/pull/192).

## [0.7.1] - 2020-02-18

### Changed
- Domains are now in [0,1] instead of [-1,1]. Quadratures and nodes arrays modified accordingly. Since commit [268dfe1](https://github.com/gridap/Gridap.jl/commit/268dfe12ef7d736fcd9ad0b9b256740aaf15b2e7).

The old API of `asseble` is still functional, but not for the `apply_constraints` et al. Since PR [#43](https://github.com/gridap/Gridap.jl/pull/43). Further changed in commit   [a335aed](https://github.com/gridap/Gridap.jl/commit/a335aede65c92a1f61f0ff0dbb0fb44cc20cf906).

### Fixed

- Bug in generation of the cellwise local to global DOF map for high order interpolations. Fixed via PR [#56](https://github.com/gridap/Gridap.jl/pull/56).
- Bug in numerical integration. There was a bug for computations where the number of cell DOFs was different from the number of integration points. Fixed via commit [0b3d4bf](https://github.com/gridap/Gridap.jl/commit/0b3d4bfadea48707c748fca0de65a51a598b6ca6)
